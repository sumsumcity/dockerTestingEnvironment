# dockerTestingEnvironment

This is my test environment to try out Docker and Django. My goal is to create multiple docker containers which also serve as a local coding environemt, so that other people would not need to download the dependencies. So when you change something in the code, the corresponding docker container should automatically start new with the updated code.
